# project-in-c
Welcome to my "Project in C" repository! This is where I upload all of the projects I've written in the C programming language.

Projects
--------
Here's a list of the projects I've uploaded so far:

Project 1: The program will prompt the user to input the current time and then display it on the screen as a digital clock. The clock will then continue to run until the user inputs a new time. The program will then update the clock to display the new time.

Getting Started
---------------
To get started with one of my projects, simply navigate to its directory in the repository and open the project files in your favorite text editor or IDE.

Contributing
